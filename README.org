Simple wrapper script to execute a script when linked to from a bin directory in
$PATH

Handles shell scripts and python scripts, with and without virtual
environments.

* Rationale
I was tired of littering

* Usage
** Clone this repository as a submodule in the main directory of the script to wrap
#+begin_src shell
  cd <your script path>
  git submodule add ssh://git@git.home.bouzou.org:222/paul/wrapper.git wrapper
#+end_src

* Platforms
- Linux and macOS
- Special consideration for scripts called via applications generated
  using [[https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus][Platypus]].
