#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

Simple wrapper script to execute a script when linked to from a bin directory in
$PATH

Handles shell scripts and python scripts, with and without virtual
environments.

* Rationale
I was tired of littering my =~/local/bin= directory with tons of stuff. Hence this wrapper, which lets you keep the particulars of a script out of sight and lets you run it.

* Usage
- Clone this repository as a submodule in the main directory of the
  script to wrap
  #+begin_src shell
    cd <your script path>
    git submodule add ssh://git@git.home.bouzou.org:222/paul/wrapper.git wrapper
  #+end_src
- Link your executable to the wrapper executable
  #+begin_src shell
    ln -s <your script path>/wrapper/wrapper.py ~/local/bin/<your script name>
  #+end_src

* Platforms
- Linux and macOS
- On macOS, special consideration for scripts called via applications generated
  using [[https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus][Platypus]].
